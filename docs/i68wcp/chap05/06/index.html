<p><span lang="en">5.6 Relative versus Absolute Judgements</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">More formally, Weber’s Law is typically stated as the detectable difference in stimulus intensity I as a fixed percentage K of the object magnitude: I/I = K.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The human perceptual system is fundamentally based on relative judgements, not absolute ones; this principle is known as Weber’s Law.</span> <span lang="en">For instance, the amount of length difference we can detect is a percentage of the object’s length.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">This principle holds true for all sensory modalities.</span> <span lang="en">The fact that our senses work through relative rather than absolute judgements has far-ranging implications.</span> <span lang="en">When considering questions such as the accuracy and discriminability of our perceptions, we must distinguish between relative and absolute judgements.</span> <span lang="en">For example, when two objects are directly next to each other and aligned, we can make much more precise judgements than when they are not aligned and when they are separated with many other objects between them.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">An example based on Weber’s Law illuminates why position along a scale can be more accurately perceived than a pure length judgement of position without a scale.</span> <span lang="en">The length judgement in Figure 5.13(a) is difficult to make with unaligned and unframed bars.</span> <span lang="en">It is easier with framing, as in Figure 5.13(b), or alignment, as in Figure 5.13(c), so that the bars can be judged against a common scale.</span> <span lang="en">When making a judgement without a common scale, the only information is the length of the bars themselves.</span> <span lang="en">Placing a common frame around the bars provides another way to estimate magnitude: we can check the length of the unfilled bar.</span> <span lang="en">Bar B is only about 15% longer than Bar A, approaching the range where length differences are difficult to judge.</span> <span lang="en">But the unfilled part of the frame for Bar B is about 50% smaller than the one for Bar A, an easily discriminable difference.</span> <span lang="en">Aligning the bars achieves the same effect without the use of a frame.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Another example shows that our perception of color and luminance is completely contextual, based on the contrast with surrounding colors.</span> <span lang="en">In Figure 5.14(a), the two labeled squares in a checkerboard appear to be quite different shades of gray.</span> <span lang="en">In Figure 5.14(b), superimposing a solid gray mask that touches both squares shows that they are identical. Conversely, Figure 5.15 shows two colorful cubes.</span> <span lang="en">In Figure 5.15(a) corresponding squares both appear to be red.</span> <span lang="en">In Figure 5.15(b), masks show that the tile color in the image apparently illuminated by a yellowish light source is actually orange, and for the bluish light the tiles are actually purple.</span> <span lang="en">Our visual system evolved to provide color constancy so that the same surface is identifiable across a broad set of illumination conditions, even though a physical light meter would yield very different readings.</span> <span lang="en">While the visual system works very well in natural environments, many of its mechanisms work against simple approaches to visually encoding information with color.</span></p>
