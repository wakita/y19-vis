<p><span lang="en">5.7 Further Reading</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Big Picture The highly influential theory of visual marks and channels was proposed by Bertin in the 1960s [Bertin 67].</span> <span lang="en">The ranking of channel effectiveness proposed in this chapter is my synthesis across the ideas of many previous authors and does not come directly from any specific source.</span> <span lang="en">It was influenced by the foundational work on ranking of visual channels through measured-response experiments [Cleveland and McGill 84a], models [Cleveland 93a], design guidelines for matching visual channels to data type [Mackinlay 86], and books on visualization [Ware 13] and cartography [MacEachren 95].</span> <span lang="en">It was also affected by the more recent work on crowdsourced judgements [Heer and Bostock 10], taxonomybased glyph design [Maguire et al. 12], and glyph design in general [Borgo et al. 13].</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Psychophysical Measurement The foundational work on the variable distinguishability of different visual channels, the categorization of channels as metathetic identity and prothetic magnitude, and scales of measurement was done by a pioneer in psychophysics [Stevens 57, Stevens 75].</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Effectiveness and Expressiveness Principles The principles of expressiveness for matching channel to data type and effectiveness for choosing the channels by importance ordering appeared in a foundational paper [Mackinlay 86].</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Perception This chapter touches on many perceptual and cognitive phenomena, but I make no attempt to explain the mechanisms that underlie them.</span> <span lang="en">I have distilled an enormous literature down to the bare minimum of what a beginning vis designer needs to get started.</span> <span lang="en">The rich literature on perception and cognitive phenomena is absolutely worth a closer look, because this chapter only scratches the surface;</span> <span lang="en">for example, the Gestalt principles are not covered.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Ware offers a broad, thorough, and highly recommended introduction to perception for vis in his two books [Ware 08, Ware 13].</span> <span lang="en">His discussion includes more details from nearly all of the topics in this chapter, including separability and popout.</span> <span lang="en">An overview of the literature on popout and other perceptual phenomena appears on a very useful page that includes interactive demos http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/ healey/PP [Healey 07];</span> <span lang="en">one of the core papers in this literature begins to untangle what low-level features are detected in early visual processing [Treisman and Gormican 88].</span></p>
